## Introduction
Memory is essential for daily life and success in academic and professional settings. Poor sleep quality can impair memory consolidation, affecting performance on memory-related tasks. Understanding this relationship can also have implications for public health, as sleep disturbances are linked to cognitive decline and other health problems. Investigating the mechanisms underlying sleep-related memory consolidation can improve our understanding of human cognition and lead to strategies to enhance memory performance and overall quality of life.

## Dataset
Variable
Meaning
Values
Subject #
numerical value assigned to each participant 
unique identifier for each participant
Condition
refers to the group participants were assigned to
AM/PM = control groups who controlled for time of day effects. These groups completed the entire experiment either in the morning (AM) or evening (PM). Sleep/Wake = experimental groups. These groups had a 12 hour retention interval between encoding and test in which they either remained awake (Wake) or had a chance to sleep (Sleep). 
Lineup
refers to what lineup test the participant received 
Target Present = lineup in which the perpetrator is present. Target Absent = lineup in which the actual perpetrator is absent
Identification 
The type of identification from the lineup the participant made
Correct ID = correct identification of the perpetrator. False ID = identification of an innocent suspect filler. No ID = participant selected that they thought the perpetrator was not in the lineup
Confidence
Participants rated their confidence in their lineup decision
1-7 with 1 being not at all confident and 7 being extremely confident
MEQ
Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire
chronotype category indicating whether the participant was classified as a Definite Morning, Moderate Morning, Definite Evening, Moderate Evening, or Neither morning or evening type
OSPAN
Operation Span
0 -75 with higher numbers indicating more accurate performance
PSQI
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
score representing overall sleep quality with higher numbers indicating poorer sleep quality
S1 SSS 
Stanford Sleepiness Scale during session 1
1-7 with higher numbers indicating more sleepiness
S2 SSS 
Stanford Sleepiness Scale during session 2
1-7 with higher numbers indicating more sleepiness
S1 PositivePANAS
Positive affect score in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for session 1
higher numbers indicating more positive affect
S1 NegativePANAS
Negative affect score in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for session 1
higher numbers indicating more negative affect
S2 PositivePANAS
Positive affect score in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for session 2
higher numbers indicating more positive affect
S2 NegativePANAS
Negative affect score in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for session 2
higher numbers indicating more negative affect
Weekly Average Sleep (minutes)
How long the participant slept, on average, the week before the experiment in minutes
minutes
Sleep before Encoding (minutes)
How long the participant slept, on average, the night before encoding in minutes
minutes
Sleep before Test (minutes)
How long the participant slept, on average, the night before test in minutes. For Wake, AM, and PM participants, this is the same value as the Sleep before Encoding
minutes
Minutes Awake after Encoding
For Sleep participants, how long they spent awake after encoding
minutes
